Facial Emotion Recognition
This project aims to develop a Facial Emotion Recognition system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify facial expressions in images into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle's "Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge" (FER2013). The dataset consists of 48x48-pixel grayscale images of faces labeled with seven emotion categories.

The dataset can be accessed from the following link: FER2013 Dataset

Please make sure to comply with the dataset's licensing terms and usage restrictions specified by Kaggle.

Project Structure
The project follows the following directory structure:

lua
Copy code
|-- data/
|   |-- FER2013.csv
|-- models/
|   |-- emotion_recognition_model.h5
|-- src/
|   |-- main.py
|-- README.md
data/: Directory containing the dataset file FER2013.csv.
models/: Directory to store the trained model weights.
src/: Directory containing the source code for the Facial Emotion Recognition system.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Usage
Download the FER2013 dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place the FER2013.csv file in the data/ directory.
Set up the required dependencies by installing the necessary libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Run the main.py script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
The trained model weights will be saved in the models/ directory.
Once the model is trained, you can use it for facial emotion recognition tasks by loading the model weights and making predictions on new images.
Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Pandas
Numpy
Please refer to the requirements.txt file for the specific versions of the libraries used in this project.
